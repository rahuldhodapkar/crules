# crules
Association rule learning toolkit for single cell sequencing data.

## Functions
### Cell State Forecasting
- by playing association rules forward according to
  a weighted value, we can forecast cell states
  at future points in time, including data that includes
  non-transcriptional values (such as chromatin accesibility or
  cellular behavior/phenotype).
